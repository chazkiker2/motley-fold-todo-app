## Project Prompt

Hello aspiring Fool!

Below you will find guidelines for a small TODO application. Our hope is that you'll find this project a bit like a blank canvas, you can fill it in however you please to show us something about yourself, thought process, and development style.

### General project guidelines

- 1-2 hours time commitment
- Choose a base project repository from the links below
- Fork/copy the repository to your personal GitHub account
- Use any publicly available packages that you need
- Include directions for installing and running your application
- Have fun! Consider modifications that highlight your development approach

### Base Project Templates

### New Feature Ideas

Here are a few starter ideas for new features. You may also choose to modify or extend these; or choose something entirely different. The world is your oyster!

- Create tags for todo items and ability to view all items by tag name
- Search todos
- Implement assignee for todo, maybe prioritization too. Listing all todos can sort by assignee/priority
- Implement “done” feature, whereby if a todo is done it gets shown in a “done” list

### Evaluation criteria

Below are the primary evaluation criteria.

- [x] Code should be hosted on GitHub
- [ ] TODO application retains original functionality
